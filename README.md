# Prompt

Create a simple web based React application that takes a stock ticker symbol as input, and
displays the stockâ€™s latest quote price. The app should query your own NodeJS server using
your own REST API. Within your NodeJS server, you will query a public stock API to retrieve the
stock quote data.
